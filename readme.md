# Event Planner App

### This project is still in progress
Current page is just one part of a bigger event planner app I'm planning to build

Current features:
* read initial data from JSON file
* upload data to local storage
* populate tables with guests
* re-arrange sitting plan by drag-and-dropping guests
* switch view to show other info than names (e.g., houses)
* add new guests to the tables
* notify when sitting arrangement exceeds table's capacity

Future features:
* use Vue/React
* build back-end in Django
* use sqlite3 database
* implement other parts of the app (tbc.)
